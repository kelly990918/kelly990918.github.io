Hi this is Kelly!<br>
I am learning some frontend programming and this my practise site~ (plus a mini personal homepage)<br>
Thanks for visiting ~(=^â€¥^)/
<br><br>
This is the only public codespace(?) but I'm also slowly taking the Harvard CS50 online course <br>
C is so so much harder than HTML stuff I think, or am I just too dumb to handle that? haha idk
