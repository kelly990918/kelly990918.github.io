##### Hi this is Kelly!
<br>
<p>I am learning some frontend programming and this my practise site~ (plus a mini personal homepage)</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting ~(=^â€¥^)/</p>
<p>This is the only public codespace(?) but I'm also slowly taking the Harvard CS50 online course</p>
<p>C is so so much harder than HTML stuff I think, or am I just too dumb to handle that? haha idk</p>
