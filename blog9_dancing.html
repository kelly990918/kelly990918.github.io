    <section class="blog">
        <p class="paragraph">It was Valentine's Day. I woke up in the afternoon again, same as I usually do, as I always stay up till 4 a.m. aimlessly, scrolling through the social media to read people complaining about nonsense and watch a bunch of brain rot reels that makes you forget about the time. But it was Valentine's Day, and I booked to date myself at the MET. I shouldn't have slept again after waking up at eight and had a Face Time call with my boyfriend till 11:30 a.m.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Where's your boyfriend then, you may ask. We are 12,786 km apart. He came to visit me, traveled all the way from Taiwan during the Chinese New Year holidays——the only long vacation he can have in the year. He returned for work a week ago. That's why we are apart now, and that left me no choice, but to go on the date myself. What a romantic thing to do on Valentine's Day!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The weather was unpleasant, windy and cloudy. Usually on such a day, other than going to school, I would rather stay inside. <i>But I paid for it already</i>, I told myself. <i>Are you going to waste the money you paid for the ticket?</i> Oh well, then I guess I have to get going.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I'm so glad that the MET opens until 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, which means I don't have to rush to the museum and run through the exhibitions in half an hour. I could even make time to go to a UPS Store to drop my Amazon return. Then I slowly took the 6 Train and hopped off at 77th Street Station, passed through Park Avenue, Madison Avenue and finally on 5th Avenue. I arrived at the museum at 5:30 p.m.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To be honest, I never had interest in arts. Sometimes I find the drawings peculiar——why do people love dots more than the realistic portraits? But who am I to judge, as a person who couldn't even draw a stick figure properly? The only thing that attracted me to visit was the MET's Egyptian Arts Collection. I am drawn to see what is seen by modern people as mysterious, that also inspires people to imagine the life in a lost civilization. I've also been to the Sanxingdui Museum in Sichuan too, looking at the bronze heads with their faces covered with gold masks, and those jade discs that reminiscent CD-ROMs. Every piece of artifacts you see were crafted with exquisite craftsmanship, which you might wonder: who taught them how to make all these?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">The Egyptian artifacts I was coming for also showed technique that would leave us all in awe——they even created their writing system! Though it's hard to find direct similarities, the hieroglyphics they used is said to be the root of the Chinese writing systems, conveying meanings in a simple and compact way. They are codes that have yet to be fully decoded. The more you look at the paragraphs, you realize there's patterns, encrypting the long, mysterious lives of the Egyptians thousands of years ago. I'm drawn to these mystiques no one can answer with certainty. The guides in the museums educate visitors confidently that the pyramids are tombs of the Pharaohs, but they know deep inside this theory could be overthrown at any moment. They could tell you &#78585; is the Ankh symbol, &#78525; is the Djed Pillar, and &#78809; is a coned-bread. But if you think beyond that, why do they appear together most of the time? Why is the Ankh not put together with the Eye of Horus &#77952;? Would they go home at night doubting what the books have told them and somehow admit that our ancestors might be so much smarter than us, perhaps be curious about what <i>really</i> happened in the past, and ponder upon the space far beyond our reach in the skies?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I was drowned in my thoughts, taking countless pictures and staring at each incomprehensible symbol like a psychopath. I was so exhausted and decided I would take a break on the benches beside the Temple of Dendur, yet I still couldn't get the heads, the eyes, the man and women, the owls, and the snakes out of my head. They started moving around in my head, as if they never died. I closed my eyes to enjoy the animation, to watch them working in the farms, harvesting, and worshiping the Sun——I saw their lives. In a moment I think I saw them building a large pyramid, which I believe is called Giza. I saw all the blueprints and how they cut the rocks and moved them around——they were floating in the air!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">I stood on the side to witness the magic happen with admiring eyes, when an old man approached me.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Julia, there you are, my dearest child!" said the man.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But how did he know my name? I was shocked, staring at him with panicked eyes, not knowing how to react.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Ah yes! You have no idea what happened. Let's go to the temples, I will let you know what's happening."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I followed the man to the other side of the construction site, into a newly finished temple. White granite shone through the interior of the structure with smooth rock-made tables, chairs made of wood, and books and documents neatly organized on the wooden bookshelf.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I walked around the room in awe, while a man's voice pulled me back to reality.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Julia, we don't have much time left," the man said to me.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"What do you mean? I asked.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"We only have a brief moment before you get back to where you came from. We've got something to tell you, something so important……"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Wait, what do you mean by that, and why me? What are you expecting me to do with all that? I'm just a normal student, I said, confusedly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"I know you are confused, but I'll have to keep the long story short. There's a tale passed through generations, that someday a time traveler from the future will be the gatekeeper of our civilization's greatest secret. She will protect that from being contaminated by our enemies from the sky and alter our history, the man said. "I am one of the prophets working for the Pharaohs, we knew your name long before you came. We've been waiting for you for decades."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">So, this is why this old man can recognize me in a flash and bring me into this temple? Sounds like a dramatic dream.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"No one knew, though, why it would be a random girl," the man continued. "But now that I'm finally meeting you, I think I know why you're the chosen one."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Why then?" I asked.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The man pointed at my arms. They were filled with markings I made in the museum; the hieroglyph symbols were like tattoos, stretching from my fingertips to my elbows.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"It seems like you know how our language works. And this is exactly what you'll have to pass on," said the wise old man. "This is your mission."</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">I guess so, after all I had the most iconic symbols all copied onto my body, and no one I knew ever questioned what they were taught by the teachers. I just need to have them verified.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Does this mean that my mission is to remember what all these symbols mean?" I asked.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The man shook his head and said, "Not exactly. Actually, I'm going to teach you how to use them to harness energy. This is our most precious secret. Now you have seen how we live, the point is that we write not only to record what happened so that people in the future could read them, but also these patterns are spells that work in every aspect of our lives."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"They are used to heal illnesses, help us win wars, and even make our meals taste better. There're infinite ways to use the energy to make our life better."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Wait a minute, I couldn't quite follow. Do you actually mean that you're passing down the spells through me? I don't even know a thing about…… witchcraft," I said.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I couldn't believe that at all! Was he asking me to deliver knowledge of ancient Egyptian rituals?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Yes, unfortunately, this is exactly what I meant," the man said. "I know you couldn't believe this, but this is the reason you're here. We need to make sure that someone can revive our great culture and know what to do when the world needs that knowledge. Please, Julia, can you do us a favor?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Of course I could help," I said, with almost zero confidence.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">And so, our class began. Alexander, as the man later introduced himself, started to give me a crash course on everything about their history, and how the Egyptian magic works: the pillars, the pyramids, the stone lions, everything——to tell me how important the set of energy rules constitute the glorious legacy of their civilization. If that worked in the past, that should work in our times too.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">He spoke very fast, but I didn't miss a word he uttered. I guess he cast a spell on me, so that I can remember everything. Indeed, that was so much more informative and convincing than listening to the guides in the museum. I think I started to believe the unseen force that rules the world. In half an hour, I became an expert on Egyptian studies, and finally got the answer to my biggest question: the Ankh is paired with the Djed pillar, or the "give" sign because they are the most powerful symbols. They magnify the energy of your spells, and theoretically, if they are properly inscribed on an object, say a cup, the energy also increases the energy frequency of the cup and every droplet you drink from it. They are the key to why the rocks could float, and I must admit that their civilization is far more advanced.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But what do I do now, having been exposed to these secrets? If I spread them in public, will I be teased and treated as a psychopath? Will they say that I'm possessed? What on earth am I going to do with all the ancient wisdom that I own?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">"I know you're confused. Just remember everything as hard as you can, best if you could write them down, one day you will know……" Wait, what? I couldn't get what Alexander meant again, but the time was up, so precisely long enough for me to know everything I <i>needed</i> to, but how—</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Wake up miss! We're closing in five minutes," I heard a woman yelling. "Wake up, we are closing. You can still come tomorrow morning, we welcome sleepers too," said the security guard, mockingly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Oh my! I'm so sorry, I was speaking to Alexander——oh no, nothing!" I made an awkward grin at the lady, and ran out of the hallway to the exit. On the way, I saw all the stones again, but now they're dancing joyfully to the songs written above their heads, and of course I could see them living an amazing life with the secret wisdom!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">The next day, I woke up before sunrise, earlier than every New Yorker does, packed a camera, every notepad in my apartment, and of course brought all the pens I have. I appeared sharply at 10 a.m. at the entrance of the MET. As the first visitor of the day, I ran into the exhibition on the right, copied down every wise word Alexander and his friends left behind dedicated to me. Before I could realize, I had already filled every corner of the papers I brought with me, and also there were blisters on my hands because I had written too much with the pens, copying and translating every word before I would forget anything. Although I remembered clearly that Alexander once said: "The greatest wisdom is always inscribed in your DNAs."</p>
